comments from the original author: 
" A simple HTML Lexer/Parser to wrap my head around lexers and parsers, the foundations of a compiler/interpreter. Since I love webscraping thought I'd give it a try! "

# Munchlex: Introduction and Project Idea
## Multi-Threaded Web Scraper in C

Munchlex is a multi-threaded web scraper written in C that resolves around the idea of a lexer/parser. 
The origin of this project started when the need to further enhance the performance of a python based web scraper was required.
originally Python based web scrapers though efficient, were only sequential in nature. This means that the page 
was parsed line by line which was time consuming. Hence, Munchlex and the idea of a multi-threaded web scraper was born.
